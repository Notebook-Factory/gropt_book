Welcome to an interactive Jupyter Book for the Magnetic Resonance in Medicine paper by Michael Loecher et al. entitled "[*A gradient optimization toolbox for general purpose time‚Äêoptimal MRI gradient waveform design*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.28384)".

This Jupyter Book lets you interact with a [demo of their code](https://github.com/cmr-group/gropt) to test their gradient optimization toolbox. You can change the code by inline on the pages or launch a MyBinder session to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook in another tab. The figures are made interactive using [Plotly](https://plotly.com).
