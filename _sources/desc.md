## GrOpt: Gradient Optimization Toolbox 
**Written in C (for compiling on scanners), with wrappers in Python and Matlab for prototyping**

Ideally **_any_** waveform can be described by a set of constraints

Currently implemented in various forms on Siemens and GE scanners

The following sections contain demos and examples of the Gradient Optimization Toolbox in action. If you want to use GrOpt yourself, [check out the documentation](https://gropt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
